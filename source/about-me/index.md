Hello my name is René González, I am a software developer and I am really commited in the development of high performance and scalable computing systems. I really enjoy working with cloud computing and artificial intelligence projects. This website was created so I can share what I have learned with the dev comunitiy, I also wanted to improve my frontend coding skills and there is no better way than running you own site. 

So as the Rolling Stones said, *Please allow me to introduce myself*. I graduated as a Mechatronics Engineer from National Autonomus University of Mexico also known as UNAM in 2016, and since then learning about software development became a very important task to me.

I am currently working at [BlueMessaging](https://www.bluemessaging.com) in Mexico city, where I am leading the development of a chatbots platform. As a software developer I have worked with various technologies at work and with my own personal projects, beeing my favourite ones *Node.js, Python, Django, Elasticsearch, Docker, AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway*.

There are some other technologies I don't now too much yet, but I hope to incorporate them into my development stack soon such as *typescript, react, responsive web design, mongodb, spark java framework and GraphQL*

Development aside as most people I also have various hobbies, my main hobby is studying Japanese. I started studying it back in August 2015, and it has been a while since then.

I will continue updating this page with some open source proyects I plan to realease soon, so keep an eye at it.
